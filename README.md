# Investing-for-Dummies

An end-to-end Java application that helps users who are new to investing to learn about how money could grow, in the style of “virtual gambling” using MVC architecture and Java Swing. 

The application will allow the user to create investment portfolios, try out buying and selling of stock, and various investment strategies to see how they can grow (or shrink) their money with time. The application is designed in a way that an individual investor may track multiple portfolios: a retirement portfolio, a college-savings portfolio, health savings portfolio, etc.

The user can access the application using two types of views - a Console based and a Graphical User Interface(GUI). The operations that could be performed on a single portfolio include the following:
- The ability to create a new portfolio
- The ability to add stocks to an existing portfolio
- The ability to buy stocks by specifying the actual amount, and date (with or without commission fees)
- The ability to buy stocks by specifying an amount, date and weight distribution (with or without commission fees)
- The ability to create an investment strategy and apply it to a portfolio
- The ability to query the cost basis and value of a portfolio at a certain date
- The ability to save and retrieve portfolios and strategies from files

The application was designed using Builder, Composite, Data Access Object and Command Design patterns.

Tools and Technologies used: Java, IntelliJ, Java Swing
